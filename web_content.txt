**Aya Healthcare Blog Post**  
**Title:** Aya Healthcare Helps CHOC Children’s Find Top‑Quality New RN Grads to Fill Residency Program Positions  
**Date:** September 4, 2018  
**Category:** Workforce Solutions  

---

### Executive Summary
CHOC Children’s Hospital (CHOC), a Magnet‑designated facility in Orange County, opens about **35 new‑graduate RN residency positions** twice a year. For one recent opening they received **776 applications** in a 7‑day window and needed to screen every applicant, guaranteeing interviews for all internal candidates.  

Because the internal HR team (only two‑and‑a‑half recruiters) could not handle the volume, CHOC turned to **Aya Healthcare’s Clinical Services** for assistance.

---

### What Aya Did
| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Screening & Interviews** | Used a virtual interviewing tool with standardized, unit‑specific questions. Sent interview links to all 776 candidates. | **560 applicants** screened and interviewed in **8 calendar days**. |
| **Disqualification** | Removed candidates lacking qualifications or who failed to interview. | Remaining pool ready for ranking. |
| **Scoring & Ranking** | Created a customized rubric; stack‑ranked candidates by specialty using weighted average scores. | Produced a ranked list for each requisition; internal candidates and referrals could receive separate score sheets. |
| **On‑site Interviews** | Top three candidates per opening invited to a two‑day on‑site interview event. | **120+ on‑site interviews** conducted. |
| **Offers** | Offers extended to fill all 35 positions; three “soft offers” made on the spot (a first for CHOC). | **All 35 positions filled**. |

---

### Key Outcomes
- **Time Saved:** Aya completed screening and interviewing of 560 candidates in 8 days, a task that would have been impossible for CHOC’s small HR team.  
- **Quality of Hire:** Aya’s rigorous vetting delivered the “best‑of‑the‑best” candidates, enabling CHOC to fill every residency slot.  
- **Process Efficiency:** Stack‑ranking and unit‑specific interview templates streamlined decision‑making for CHOC leadership.  
- **Internal Satisfaction:** Internal candidates received guaranteed interview opportunities, maintaining morale.  

> *“It’s because of Aya’s intense screening and vetting process that we found the best‑of‑the‑best candidates from such a large application pool. They saved us a tremendous amount of time and administrative burden…”* – **Mark Steiman, Executive Director of Human Resources, CHOC**

**Aya Traveler Brianna is a DAISY Award Winner!**  
*Published September 28, 2018 – Clinician Stories*

---

### Overview
Brianna, an Aya travel nurse, was honored with a **DAISY Award** after being nominated by a charge nurse for her compassionate care and strong patient advocacy.

---

### Story Details  

**Why Brianna was nominated**

> “During that conversation I could see how much the patient trusted Brianna and how she looked to her for support to express these difficult wishes. I was very concerned how the patient’s children would handle this information but Brianna facilitated the process seamlessly; I could really see the rapport she had developed with this family. She asked the teaching staff for time for the patient to have a private conversation with her children and was such a compassionate support system for all of them. She had the teaching staff come back in afterward to answer questions and address concerns. Based on all of this the patient, with the support of her children, made the decision to change her code status to DNR/DNI. The interactions I witnessed this weekend were very special and I know they meant the world to the patient.”  

*Excerpt from the charge nurse’s nomination.*

**Recognition**

- Brianna’s actions exemplify the core values celebrated by the DAISY Award:
  - Role‑modeling professional nursing standards  
  - Making a significant difference in a patient’s life  
  - Building trust and emotional support with patients and families  
  - Demonstrating clinical excellence and critical‑thinking skills  
  - Providing compassionate, patient‑centered care

Your dedication and empathy made a lasting impact on the patient, her family, and the care team.

**Category:** Clinician Stories (Aya Healthcare Blog)

### Summary  
Kayla, an Aya travel PICU nurse, was honored with the DAISY Award for her extraordinary compassion and dedication to a young PICU patient and his family. The family’s heartfelt testimonial highlights the many “little things” Kayla did that made a profound difference during a stressful hospital stay. Aya’s Travel Experience team surprised Kayla with the award in Dallas, Texas, presenting her with a DAISY pin, certificate, and a “The Healer’s Touch” sculpture.

### Family Testimonial (excerpt)

> “With an unexpected turn in our lives, we couldn’t have been more thankful and blessed with such an amazing, caring and passionate nurse. Kayla showed genuine compassion from the first day we met her… She was always there to answer any questions and address any concerns we had. She had open ears and was willing to try anything to make our son comfortable…  
>   
> On the day of our son’s surgery, Kayla stopped by before heading home to ask how everything went and how glad she was that he was doing so well. While these things may sound little, it’s the little things that made the situation less painful…  
>   
> After our son’s surgery and recovery, we were sent home and returned the next day due to an infection. Kayla was once again there to answer our questions, distract our minds with small conversations and show her love towards our son…  
>   
> To sum it all up, Kayla created a bond not only with our baby but our family as well. We couldn’t be more thankful for all her help and for being an advocate for our son when he cannot advocate for himself.”

**Health Frontiers in Tijuana Clinic – Blog Post (Aya Healthcare)**  

**Title:** How are UCSD Students solving global health problems with Aya Healthcare’s help?  

**Date:** January 31, 2022  
**Category:** Aya in the Community  

---

### Overview
The post highlights the work of the **Health Frontiers in Tijuana (HFiT) clinic**, a cross‑border health‑care hub operated by clinicians, professors, and students from the United States and Mexico. It explains how the clinic serves a diverse, underserved population and how UC San Diego (UCSD) students, together with Aya Healthcare, contribute to its mission.

---

### Key Points from the Video / Transcript  

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **Impact of Poverty** | Poverty limits access to health care, nutritious food, safe housing, and a healthy environment. It also raises stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) that increase risk for mental‑health and metabolic problems. |
| **Purpose of HFiT** | Created as a partnership between UCSD students/faculty and UABC (Universidad Autónoma de Baja California) students to address public‑health challenges at the U.S./Mexico border and generate research with global relevance. |
| **Population Served** | Patients include U.S. nationals, migrants, deportees, refugees, asylum seekers, veterans, transgender individuals, and people living with or at risk for HIV. Many lack identification or health‑insurance coverage, facing structural barriers and stigma. |
| **Services Provided** | Primary care, mental‑health services, and, when possible, additional specialties. The clinic aims to be a “one‑stop‑shop” with integrated, multidisciplinary care. |
| **Student Involvement** | Students from nursing, medicine, psychology, social work, dentistry, and allied health fields participate in direct patient care, program development, and research. |
| **Student‑Driven Programs** | Example: A student introduced mindfulness and meditation sessions for refugees, emphasizing self‑care and health‑system navigation. |
| **Geographic Reach** | Patients come from across the United States (not just the West Coast), illustrating that structural vulnerability is a national issue. |
| **Aya Healthcare’s Role** | Aya provided critical resources (e.g., funding for an ultrasound) that expanded maternal‑child health services, allowing the clinic to identify and treat severe cases promptly. |
| **Educational Component** | Clinical work is complemented by coursework at UCSD and UABC, fostering destigmatization and community education. |
| **Broader Implications** | The challenges observed at the border reflect global health inequities; solutions developed here can inform other communities worldwide. |

---

### Quote Highlights  

- *“Poverty definitely has a significant impact on health outcomes on many levels…”*  
- *“The HFiT clinic really serves as a safety net for this really wide array of patients…”*  
- *“Aya has been a tremendous help for us to provide additional services that are not being provided currently to people that do not have any insurance and to migrants.”*  
- *“There’s a story behind every person that’s coming to the clinic… humanization is an important piece of it.”*

**Title**  
NPR Boston: Hospitals Have Turned to More Staffing With Travel Nurses in the Face of Critical Staffing Shortages  

**Date**  
February 3, 2022  

**Source**

At the time of the interview there were **over 35,000 travel‑nurse positions open nationally** and **more than 700 openings in Massachusetts**. The surge is driven by critical staffing shortages in hospitals, prompting many facilities to rely heavily on travel nurses to maintain patient care.

**Key Points**  

| Topic | Details |

| **Demand** | > 35,000 travel‑nurse jobs nationwide; > 700 in MA |

| **Impact** | Hospitals increasingly depend on travel nurses to fill gaps; higher costs and competition for qualified nurses |

**Aya Healthcare Experts Published in *Nurse Leader***  
*Published: March 29, 2022*  

**Authors:**  
- Carol Tuttas, PhD, RN – Clinical Manager, Aya Healthcare  
- April Hansen, MSN, RN – Group President of Workforce Solutions, Aya Healthcare  

**Article Overview**  
The authors examined the rapid growth of travel nursing and its impact on the U.S. nurse‑staffing landscape. They also offered practical suggestions for nurse leaders to adapt to these changes.

### Key Findings

- **Travel nursing’s role:** Historically a niche solution for temporary staffing gaps (e.g., attrition, seasonal surges, special projects).  
- **Workforce size (2019):** ~43,000 travel RNs out of 2,982,280 registered nurses ≈ < 2 % of the nursing workforce.  
- **Recent surge:** In the past two years (coinciding with COVID‑19), many more nurses chose travel positions, attracted by higher pay, flexibility, autonomy, and opportunities for skill development.  
- **Benefits for nurses:** Ability to schedule breaks between contracts, improve work‑life balance, avoid burnout, and gain diverse clinical experiences.  
- **Leadership challenge:** Leaders must monitor work‑environment pressures and adopt new strategies to meet evolving expectations.

### Six Actionable Suggestions for Nurse Leaders

1. **Budget and hire adequate non‑RN support roles** – strengthen the support infrastructure.  
2. **Adopt the skill of “teaming.”** – foster collaborative, interdisciplinary teams.  
3. **Enhance collaboration between travel staff and permanent staff** – create seamless integration.  
4. **Harness the power of empathy** – understand and address staff concerns.  
5. **Consider team‑nursing models and shorter shift durations** – improve workflow and satisfaction.  
6. **Reach out to re‑hireable former RN employees** – retain experienced talent.

### Conclusion  

Understanding why nurses pursue travel roles helps leaders design environments where both travel and permanent staff feel valued, cohesive, and satisfied.

**Digging Into the Data: Travel Nurse Demographics**  
*May 20, 2022 | Workforce Solutions*  
*By Cristal Mackay, Vice President, Advisory Solutions*

---

### Overview
- Only **66,790** registered nurses (RNs) were employed in the temporary (travel) market in May 2021, **2.34 %** of the total RN workforce (3,047,530).  
- Travel nursing appeals to a specific demographic because of its mobile lifestyle.

---

### Key Findings

| Demographic Insight | Travel Nurses | General RN Workforce |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Average Age** | 35 years (average) | 52 years (2020 National Nursing Workforce Survey) |
| **Age < 35** | Majority | Not specified |
| **Age > 50** | 11 % | ~50 % of all nurses |
| **Marital Status – Married** | 30 % | 71.5 % |
| **Gender – Male** | 18.3 % (nearly double) | 9.4 % (2020) |
| **Race/Ethnicity – White/Caucasian** | 63 % | 76 % |
| **Non‑White / Multiracial** | 37 % | 24 % |

---

### Interpretation & Implications

1. **Younger, Single Workforce**  
   - Travel nurses tend to be younger and unmarried, often without a mortgage or school‑aged children.  
   - Flexibility is a major draw; many take short (≈13‑week) contracts and use time between assignments for travel, volunteering, or extended personal projects (e.g., seasonal work on farms).

2. **Gender Dynamics**  
   - Male nurses are almost twice as represented among travelers compared with the overall RN pool.  
   - Male travel nurses are typically younger, more likely to be married, and may have children. Travel assignments can provide a single‑income model that supports families while allowing a mobile lifestyle.

3. **Greater Racial/Ethnic Diversity**  
   - The travel nurse population is more diverse than the national RN workforce, suggesting travel roles may attract or retain a broader range of candidates.  
   - Hospitals should include travelers in employee surveys and diversity initiatives to capture fresh perspectives and improve inclusivity.

4. **Retention Strategies for Younger Nurses**  
   - To attract similar talent for permanent positions, consider flexible leave policies (unlimited PTO, mandatory recharge time, volunteer leave, sabbaticals).  
   - Emphasize work‑life balance and opportunities for short‑term assignments or varied experiences.

5. **Data‑Driven Workforce Planning**  
   - Aya Healthcare’s analytics can further break down travel nurse characteristics (years of experience, home state, education, etc.).  
   - Contact **WorkforceSolutions@ayahealthcare.com** for a deeper dive or presentation.

---

### Summary  

Health‑systems are facing an unprecedented nursing shortage. 212,805 direct‑hire RN openings have been posted nationwide – a 116 % increase over pre‑pandemic levels.  Aya’s Permanent Staff Recruitment team has worked with ~103 health systems in the past year and discovered that **longer time‑to‑offer** dramatically slows hiring.

---

### Key Recommendations for Talent‑Acquisition Teams & Hiring Managers  

| Recommendation | Why It Matters | Practical Tips |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Meaningful feedback** | Helps recruiters refine sourcing and lets candidates improve, keeping them engaged. | Use a short, structured feedback template (strengths, gaps, next steps). Deliver within 24 h of interview. |
| **Quick turnaround times** | Delays cause candidate drop‑off and push talent to competitors. | Set internal SLAs: <br>• Screen → interview ≤ 4 days <br>• Interview → decision ≤ 3 days <br>• Decision → offer ≤ 2 days |
| **Internal commitment** | Hiring managers are busy, but must prioritize interview scheduling and feedback. | Block dedicated interview slots each week; treat interview feedback as a KPI. |
| **Frequent communication cadence** | Keeps candidates warm and reduces the “ghosting” effect. | Send status updates at least every 48 h, even if there’s no change. Use automated email/text nudges. |
| **Analyze process bottlenecks** | Identifies hidden delays (e.g., approvals, background checks). | Map the end‑to‑end hiring workflow; run a weekly “time‑to‑offer” report and act on outliers. |

---

### Why Speed Is Critical  

- **Candidate interest decays quickly:** The longer the gap between interview and offer, the higher the probability a candidate will accept another role.  
- **Competitive market:** Other health systems are moving at 4‑11 days from application to offer; those averaging 26‑32 days lose talent.  
- **Staffing shortages are historic:** With millions of open positions, every day of delay translates into unfilled shifts, overtime costs, and potential impacts on patient care.

**Takeaway:**  
To win in today’s talent‑war, health‑system talent‑acquisition teams must **act fast, give clear feedback, and stay relentlessly communicative**. Shortening the application‑to‑offer window from weeks to days is the most effective lever to secure top nursing talent.

**Aya Helps New Hampshire Project with Long‑Term Care Staffing**  
*Published August 5, 2022 – “What’s Working: Featured Case Studies”*  

---

### Overview
Healthcare consultant **Christi Green** partnered with a State of New Hampshire‑sponsored initiative aimed at boosting staffing levels in long‑term care (LTC) facilities. The effort was critical during the COVID‑19 pandemic to free acute‑care beds for new patients while ensuring that recovering patients could receive proper care in LTC settings.

### Key Points
- **Objective:** Support hospitals in transitioning patients from acute care to long‑term care, alleviating bed shortages during the pandemic.  
- **Aya Healthcare’s Role:** Provided contingent labor to three LTC facilities—**Northeast Rehab, Premier Nursing and Rehab,** and **Edgewood Nursing and Rehab**.  
- **Staff Delivered:** 46 professionals, including:
  - Registered Nurses (RNs) for long‑term care and medical‑surgical units  
  - Physical Therapists (PTs)  
  - Occupational Therapists (OTs)  

- **Benefits Highlighted by Facility Managers:**
  - Rapid responsiveness  
  - Proactive communication  

- **Client Testimonial (Christi Green):**  
  > “The impact that Aya and their nurses made in our state was instrumental. We needed help during the middle of the pandemic, and Aya came through for us. Without their support, we could not have moved long‑term‑care patients out of acute‑care beds, which would have left very sick patients stuck in our emergency‑department hallway.”

### Outcomes
- **Improved Patient Flow:** Enabled timely discharge of patients from hospitals to LTC facilities.  
- **Reduced Emergency Department Congestion:** Prevented hallway boarding of acute‑care patients.  
- **Enhanced Capacity for Acute Care:** Freed up beds for new COVID‑19 and other critical patients.

### Full Text (cleaned)

> In a patient’s time of need, a nurse’s compassion can make all the difference. Our Aya team recently awarded ICU RN, Stacy Arnold, with a DAISY Award after she was nominated by her patient’s daughter for the generosity she showed while helping him pull off a heart‑warming surprise for his wife. To honor her achievement, Stacy and her husband attended a special dinner where she had the chance to celebrate and meet her recruiter, Doug, in person for the first time!  
> 
> **Find out more about Stacy’s nomination and the sweet anniversary celebration she helped her patient plan:**  
> 
> _“With Stacy’s help, my dad concocted a little plan to do something for my mom on their anniversary, which he’s never missed. Stacy went above and beyond what would have been a nice gesture for a patient. My dad was on day 15 of his health journey, which started with ER and ICU care that saved his life, only to learn the hard‑to‑hear diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer. The compassion Stacy exhibited to my parents and family through the generous and heartfelt act of helping them celebrate another year together can only be described as a ‘God thing.’”_  
> 
> _“On the day of the surprise, Stacy came in before her shift and hung up a ‘Happy Anniversary’ banner, some pennants and put a white tablecloth over my dad’s rolling food table. She also got several miniature cupcakes, chocolates, two plastic champagne glasses and little sparkling apple‑cider bottles, resourcefully using dad’s hospital water pitcher as an ice bucket! Stacy topped it off with a (air‑quality safe) pinwheel bouquet that she designed. Over near the sink, she prepared a full dining experience with shiny gold plates, matching plastic ware, gold‑striped napkins and dinner for two. Finally, Stacy worked with my dad on a prior shift to create a playlist, bringing much levity to all that he was enduring and thinking in the wee hours of the night. Stacy put the songs on her personal phone and left it playing on dad’s food table. She also dimmed the room lights for a romantic surprise for my mom when she walked in.”_  
> 
> _“When my mom arrived and entered my dad’s room there was barely a dry eye on the unit floor. It gave my mom a moment to let go of some of the emotions that had been building under such a whirlwind of change. It also ultimately gave them time to celebrate the gift of another year together. Stacy gracefully wouldn’t accept any reimbursement when I offered several times. She only asked that my family pay it forward. She said that after hearing about my dad, she was sure that he had paid much forward in his life and now it was his turn to receive.”_  
> 
> _“It’s my hope that inspiration and good can come from this story of a caregiver demonstrating such a loving act of blessing a relative stranger under her care. It is our family’s honor to recommend Stacy Arnold for special recognition. The biggest and most heartfelt thank you to her and the many outstanding individuals who cared for us.”_

> **Thank you, Stacy, for your generosity and for bringing joy to your patients in their most difficult moments.**

**Title:**  
HLTH: Transforming Healthcare Workforce Management with AI and Predictive Analytics  

**Publication Date:**  
December 20, 2023  

**Categories:**  
- Newsroom Featured  
- Workforce Solutions  

**Source:**  
Aya Healthcare (original blog post) – [Read the full story on HLTH.com](https://www.hlth.com/digital-content/hlth-matters/blog/transforming-healthcare-workforce-management-with-ai-and-predictive-analytics)  

---

### Overview
Aya Healthcare’s Executive Vice President of Advisory Solutions, **Jackie Larson**, explains how artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics are reshaping workforce planning, scheduling, and contingent‑labor management in hospitals and health systems.

---

## 1. Removing Guesswork from Workforce & Capacity Planning  

### Traditional Approach  
- Staffing levels estimated from number of beds or average census.  
- Ignores variables such as emerging needs, new‑graduate productivity, contractor/ international staff availability, etc.  

### Resulting Challenges  
| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Under‑staffing** | Compromises patient care and staff morale during peak demand. |
| **Over‑staffing** | Increases labor costs; sending staff home reduces financial health. |
| **Mismatched staffing** | Poor skill‑patient fit → lower quality & safety. |
| **Burnout** | Inconsistent, unpredictable staffing leads to staff fatigue. |

### AI‑Driven Solution  
- Analyzes thousands of data points: historic census, weather, community health trends, EMR‑derived patient acuity/diagnoses.  
- Predicts patient volumes with **>90 % accuracy**.  
- Enables demand‑driven labor budgets and hiring plans **12‑18 months** ahead.

---

## 2. Removing Guesswork from Scheduling  

### Current Landscape  
- Many enterprise schedulers exist but rarely show a full picture (internal + external contingent staff, department activity, ADT).  

### AI‑Powered Scheduling (Aya Workforce AI)  
1. **Predict Future Patient Volume** – Forecast needed physicians & nurses.  
2. **Distribute Resources** – Prioritize existing staff before turning to contract labor.  
3. **Optimize Schedules** – Balance provider preferences, policy, and regulatory constraints.  

- Hour‑by‑hour volume predictions produce schedules that **outperform manual ones**, revealing significant cost‑saving opportunities.

---

## 3. Removing Guesswork from Contingent‑Labor Utilization  

### Market Context  
- Pandemic boosted travel‑nursing demand; now hospitals must re‑evaluate contingent labor as a strategic tool (seasonal spikes, leaves, etc.).  

### Aya’s Advantage  
- Largest talent‑software & staffing platform in the U.S. → rich **clinician engagement data**.  
- Predicts which pay packages clinicians will accept, delivering **real‑time, market‑validated pricing**.  

### Benefits  
- Avoids over‑paying for temporary staff.  
- Provides **detailed analysis of contingent‑labor demand, talent supply, and clinician engagement**.  
- Offers **job‑market performance insights before posting**, helping managers maximize candidate engagement and control costs.

---

## 4. Key Takeaways  

- **Predictive analytics + AI** give hospitals a data‑driven way to forecast demand, schedule staff, and manage contingent labor.  
- Accuracy > 90 % translates into more reliable labor budgets and reduced reliance on guesswork.  
- Aya’s Workforce AI integrates internal staffing data with external market intelligence, delivering actionable pricing and staffing recommendations.  
- Optimized schedules improve staff satisfaction, reduce burnout, and enhance patient safety.

## 1. Types of AI Relevant to Healthcare  

| # | AI Type | Description & Example |
|---|---------|-----------------------|
| 1 | **Rule‑Based Logic** | Early AI using decision‑support rules (e.g., automated shift approvals). |
| 2 | **Machine Learning** | Learns from data to predict outcomes (e.g., forecasting patient volumes, staffing needs). |
| 3 | **Deep Learning & Neural Networks** | Recognizes complex patterns for precision medicine and disease detection. |
| 4 | **Generative AI** | Produces new content (e.g., ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot) to assist communication and documentation. |

---

## 2. AI in Workforce Management  

- **Problem with Traditional Models:** Rely on static data → over‑ or understaffing.  
- **AI Solution:** Predictive scheduling that aligns staff levels with real‑time patient demand, reducing administrative load on nurse managers.  

> *“Our workforce is getting smaller, and our patients are getting sicker. We have to embrace technology, not to replace our clinicians, but to support them.”* – Rudy Jackson  

### Key Benefits
- More accurate staffing forecasts  
- Optimized shift assignments  
- Decreased manual adjustments and paperwork  

---

## 3. Aya’s Workforce AI Platform  

A suite that augments existing scheduling systems with predictive analytics:

- **Forecast Workforce Needs** – Anticipates hiring requirements months ahead.  
- **Optimize Scheduling** – Predicts staff numbers per shift before finalizing schedules.  
- **Automate Staffing Plans** – Generates balanced plans quickly, easing manager workload.  

> *“AI isn’t here to replace us; it’s here to enable us… saving time and enhancing our ability to deliver care.”* – Dani Bowie  

---

## 4. AI Implementation at UW Health  

| Application | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Automated Clinical Notes** | AI creates notes from MyChart data, cutting nurses’ documentation time. |
| **Precision Staffing** | AI scores patient workload from EMR data, balances nurse assignments, reduces burnout, improves satisfaction. |
| **End‑of‑Shift Reports** | AI aggregates multi‑source data into comprehensive shift summaries. |

---

## 5. Challenges & Path Forward  

- **Roadmap Development:** Need clear, phased plans for AI integration.  
- **Change Management:** Overcome initial resistance through education and demonstrating value.  
- **Collaboration:** Share best practices across organizations to accelerate adoption.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways  

- **Administrative Relief:** AI reduces routine burdens, letting clinicians focus on patient care.  
- **Problem‑First Approach:** Deploy AI to solve specific, identified challenges rather than adopting technology for its own sake.  
- **Industry Collaboration:** Joint effort is essential for innovation, knowledge sharing, and establishing standards.

**Article Summary**  
Zac Shepard, who has spent 11 years as an ICU travel nurse, explains how he selects shoes that keep him comfortable during 12‑hour shifts that involve 6‑8 miles of walking. He emphasizes two key shoe attributes:

1. **Midsole material** – provides cushioning and shock absorption.

- Breathable mesh upper  
- Fresh Foam midsole cushioning  
- Lightweight and easy to pack  
- Looks professional both in the hospital and on travel days.

These shoes are marketed as “nurse‑approved” walking shoes and are designed specifically for clinicians who spend long hours on their feet.

**Key Take‑aways for Travel Nurses**  

| Factor | Why It Matters | Recommended Feature |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Cushioning** | Reduces foot fatigue during long shifts | Fresh Foam or similar midsole |
| **Breathability** | Prevents overheating and blisters | Mesh or perforated upper |
| **Weight & Packability** | Easy to carry in luggage or a scrubs bag | Lightweight design |
| **Professional Appearance** | Works with scrubs and casual travel wear | Clean, neutral styling |
| **Durability** | Withstands daily hospital wear and travel | Quality outsole, reinforced toe |

**Suggested Shoe Model**  
- **Figs × New Balance 3447** – meets all the above criteria and is highlighted by Shepard as his daily‑use shoe.

### Article

For most folks, the holidays are a time of reunions and tradition—loved ones coming home from out of town, kids back from college, and living rooms full of joy and laughter.  

However, my holidays have been far from traditional for the last six years as an ICU travel nurse. Most Thanksgivings and Christmases, I’ve traded home‑cooked meals and family gatherings for hospital hallways and patient care across the country.  

It’s easy for most of us to forget that sickness and emergencies don’t take a holiday break. They don’t wait for the season to pass, and behind every patient in need is a team of clinicians putting their celebrations aside to deliver care.  

In my eleven years as an ICU RN, I’ve worked many holiday shifts as a staff nurse and as a traveler. While most clinicians accept that working holidays comes with the territory, it takes on another layer of meaning as a traveler—you’re serving your patients, community, and colleagues. Travelers who take assignments during the holidays often help cover shifts for permanent staff, allowing them to spend time with their families.  

**A memorable Christmas Eve**

Years ago, I was working the night shift in an ICU in Colorado on Christmas Eve. It was an incredibly busy night, even by ICU standards. Between the holiday “skeleton crew” and new admissions from the ED, we all had our hands full. In fact, it was so busy that although we’d all brought dishes for a potluck, we never got the chance to sit down and enjoy a meal together.  

Between my assignment and helping other nurses, it was almost a shift change when I finally caught up with my tasks. As I charted my I/Os, I saw a coworker staring out the big window facing the mountains. The first light of dawn was beginning to shift the colors outside. Something about the stillness of the scene pulled me in, and I walked over to stand beside her. A few seconds later, another nurse passed by, paused, and joined us. Together, we stood in silence for a few moments. That was the first time it occurred to me—it was Christmas morning.  

The quiet and beauty of that moment was such a contrast to the chaos of the last twelve hours. As a clinician for many years, I’ve learned to seek out these moments of reflection—there’s always been something grounding in seeing the world still turning outside the hospital walls. The work of healthcare can be chaotic and stressful, and the hours can be long—the tasks keep us all busy, but my choice to stay connected to the deeper purpose of healthcare is what keeps me going.  

Every shift is an opportunity to make an impact, regardless of the date on the calendar and even beyond the patient right in front of me. That Christmas, that quiet moment of reflection was my reminder that even during the toughest shifts, I’m a part of something far more significant than myself.

**CISOs Gain Prominence with Broader Roles**  
*Aya Healthcare – Blog*  

**Publication Date:** January 13 2025  
**Categories:** Aya Media Buzz, Newsroom Featured  

---

### Overview
Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are moving beyond traditional “technical‑only” responsibilities and becoming integral business leaders. The article highlights insights from Tim Dzierzek, CISO of Aya Healthcare, and backs the trend with recent industry research.

### Key Points

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Expanded Responsibilities** | 72 % of security decision‑makers say their role now includes additional duties (CSO’s 2024 Security Priorities Study). Top new duties: <br>• Cybersecurity strategy & policy development <br>• Risk management <br>• Securing AI‑enabled technology <br>• Innovation & emerging tech <br>• Security architecture & tech updates |
| **Greater Board Interaction** | 92 % now have increased engagement with the board (up from 85 % in 2023). Deloitte 2024 survey: 41 % of leaders report board discussions on cyber at least monthly; 30 % meet weekly. |
| **Shift in Focus** | Dzierzek describes a move from “a room of security professionals” to a role centered on **risk and trust management** across the organization. |
| **Business Integration** | • CISO now partners with CIO on digital transformation.<br>• Acts as a key advisor on data governance, AI governance, and how technology supports business goals.<br>• Moves from a back‑room function to guiding secure business operations. |
| **Collaboration & Relationship Building** | Emphasis on meeting with various business units; the CISO role now includes a strong relationship component. |
| **Well‑being & Stress Management** | Dzierzek uses Marine Corps‑honed coping mechanisms: regular runs, short breaks, and non‑security activities. He acknowledges past burnout and stresses the importance of stepping back during incidents. |
| **External References** | • CSO’s 2024 Security Priorities Study (foundryco.com) <br>• Deloitte Future of Cyber Survey 2024 (deloitte.com) <br>• Related CSO Online articles on risk storytelling and CISO responsibilities. |
| **Full Story Link** | https://www.csoonline.com/article/3626973/cisos-embrace-rise-in-prominence-with-broader-business-authority.html |

### Quote from Tim Dzierzek (CISO, Aya Healthcare)
> “I’m definitely seeing more involvement of security in the business that you haven’t seen in the past, whether it’s data governance and now even AI governance, to really harness artificial intelligence for us and our customers.”  

> “It’s a change from a back‑room security function to guiding companies in a secure way.”

### Takeaway
CISOs are evolving into strategic partners who influence overall business direction, risk posture, and technology adoption. Their increased visibility with executive leadership and boards reflects the critical role security now plays in achieving organizational objectives. Maintaining personal resilience is essential as the scope and pressure of the role continue to grow.

*Published February 4, 2025 – Workforce Solutions*  

---

### Overview  
At the 2024 Aya Ideas Retreat, Julie Hilsenbeck (DNS, RN, CNRN, Associate VP of Clinical Operations, Providence Nursing Institute) and Mark Smith (GVP, Insights, Optimization & Staffing, Providence) discussed how Providence transformed its workforce management.  

- **Providence**: Catholic health system operating 51 hospitals, ~1,000 clinics, and ~124,000 caregivers across seven Western U.S. states.  
- **Challenges**: High turnover, long vacancy periods, growing reliance on contingent labor after COVID‑19.  
- **Goal**: Centralize and simplify contingent‑labor management with a single, data‑driven platform.  

---

### The Solution  

| Area | What Providence Needed | Aya’s Offering | Key Quote |
|------|------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Integrated Platform** | Unified, data‑driven system for all regions/facilities. | **LotusOne** VMS – a single‑platform approach that replaces multiple MSPs and integrates with existing tech upgrades. | “We can’t afford to manage a neighborhood anymore… we want everyone to live in one house.” – Mark Smith |
| **Data‑Driven Insights** | Real‑time staffing data, rates, location trends to build trust and guide decisions. | LotusOne analytics provide program data, market dynamics, vendor productivity metrics. | — |
| **Governance & Consistency** | Standardized staffing practices and contracts across independent regional agreements. | VMS “rules of the road” framework – single set of procedures, expectations, and contracts. | “We needed to move from being managed by the investment to managing the investment.” – Julie Hilsenbeck |
| **Adaptability & Critical‑Situation Support** | Rapid response to unexpected staffing spikes (e.g., a statewide strike). | Dedicated onsite team, 24/7 support, quick mobilization of Aya’s talent network. | “I can call anybody—any time of the day or night—and I get an answer in five minutes.” – Julie Hilsenbeck |

2. Provide actionable insights that drive cost savings and performance accountability.  
3. Deliver rapid, on‑demand support for critical staffing emergencies.  

The result is a scalable, sustainable staffing model that not only meets immediate needs but also positions Providence for long‑term workforce stability and growth.

### Article Summary  

A nurse‑friend recently moved from bedside work to an outpatient IV clinic, dubbing it her “soft nursing era.” This sparked the author’s reflection on how nursing careers now evolve in **seasons**—periods of growth, stability, advancement, or rest—rather than following a single, linear path.

- **Flexibility:** Allows nurses to choose when, where, and how often they work.  
- **Career Exploration:** Lets nurses test different units or hospitals without a long‑term staff commitment.  
- **Technology‑Enabled:** Apps like **Shifts** let nurses claim open hospital shifts with a swipe; in six months of last year, per‑diem RNs filled **113,000** shifts via the app.  
- **Demographic Appeal:**  
  - *Nurses > 50* (≈ 25 % of the workforce) can stay in patient care on their own terms.  
  - *Younger nurses* can balance family, vacations, or side hustles.  

#### Personal Experience  
- The author worked per‑diem before becoming a travel nurse, using it to discover what truly mattered in her career.  
- Per‑diem provided “balance, breathing room, and time to figure out what I actually wanted.”  

#### Real‑World Example  
- The nurse friend from the opening story returned to bedside work via a per‑diem shift, discovering she missed direct patient care and found a better fit for her life.

#### Call to Action  
- If you’re curious about per‑diem nursing, try a few shifts.

**Healthcare Brew: AI for Nurse Staffing**  
*Published September 17, 2025*  

**Source:** Aya Healthcare – “Healthcare Brew: How this healthcare exec is helping make health systems more efficient with AI”

### Key Details
- **Author / Speaker:** Dani Bowie, SVP of Workforce AI (LinkedIn profile)  
- **Featured AI Solution:** **Workforce AI** – Aya’s predictive‑analytics platform that creates near‑perfect nurse staffing schedules using thousands of historical data points from a hospital’s internal and external systems.  
- **Impact Highlight:**  
  - Staffing‑accuracy improvement for a major health system: **38 % → 83 %** in one year.  
  - Enables auto‑balancing of schedules after self‑scheduling, saving **hours of manual effort each week** for nurse leaders.  

### Summary of the Story
Dani Bowie explains how Aya’s Workforce AI leverages machine‑learning models trained on extensive historical staffing, patient‑census, and operational data. The platform predicts demand, matches it with available nursing staff, and generates schedules that respect both hospital needs and nurse well‑being. By automating the balancing step after nurses self‑schedule, the tool reduces the time staff spend adjusting rosters manually, cuts labor‑cost volatility, and improves overall schedule reliability.

### Why It Matters
- **Better Patient Care:** More accurate staffing ensures the right number of nurses are present when needed, reducing overtime and burnout.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Hospitals can control labor expenses by minimizing over‑staffing and last‑minute agency hires.  
- **Scalable Solution:** The same AI engine can be applied across multiple facilities within a health system, learning from each site’s unique patterns.

### Summary  
The healthcare sector is facing a staffing crisis that goes beyond simple scheduling problems. Rising patient demand and shrinking workforce resources are turning staffing into a strategic issue that impacts clinical outcomes, finances, compliance, and overall organizational resilience.  

Artificial intelligence (AI) is positioned as both a disruptive force and a necessary solution. Executives must now treat workforce management as a board‑level priority. Dr. Dani Bowie argues that AI can help health systems **anticipate demand spikes, improve scheduling fairness, and reduce administrative burdens that fuel burnout**—but only if the technology is deployed with the human workforce at its core.

| **Leadership Perspective** | Dr. Dani Bowie (Aya Healthcare) emphasizes that AI must augment—not replace—human staff. |

### Full Article Text (cleaned)

> “The healthcare industry is confronting a crisis that can no longer be managed with incremental fixes. Limited staffing resources are colliding with relentlessly growing patient demand, turning what once seemed like a tactical issue of scheduling shifts into a strategic fault line that touches every corner of the sector, including clinical outcomes, financial sustainability, regulatory compliance and organizational resilience.  
> 
> Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged at the center of this tension, both as a disruptive force and as a necessary solution. Healthcare executives can no longer afford to treat workforce management as an administrative afterthought. It has become a boardroom‑level concern with direct implications for competitiveness.  
> 
> This spring, Dr. Dani Bowie, Senior Vice President for Workforce AI at Aya Healthcare, released her book *Reimagine Workforce Management with AI: A Roadmap for Healthcare Leaders*. In a recent BizTechReports vidcast interview, she contended that technology can help organizations anticipate and adapt to demand surges, improve fairness in scheduling and ease administrative burdens that contribute to burnout. She was quick to add that adoption must keep the human workforce at the center of transformation.”

### Takeaway  

AI can transform healthcare staffing from a reactive, manual process into a proactive, equitable system—**but success hinges on keeping clinicians and staff at the heart of every technological rollout**. Leaders are urged to view workforce management as a strategic, board‑level priority and to leverage AI tools that enhance, rather than replace, human judgment and care.

**3 Ways Travel Nursing Can Reset Your Career**  
*Published November 15, 2023 – Aya Healthcare Blog*  

---

### Overview  
Zac Shepherd, an Aya nurse fellow, shares how travel nursing revived his passion for nursing after five years as a permanent staff nurse. He outlines three major benefits that made travel nursing a true “career reset” for him.

---

## 1. Flexibility  
- **Control over schedule and location** – Able to align assignments with personal events (e.g., brother’s overseas wedding) and take extra time to explore.  
- **Adaptable work rhythm** – Choose back‑to‑back assignments for rapid career progress or insert longer breaks for mental‑health and family time.  
- **Work‑life balance** – Reduces missed moments with friends and family, allowing a healthier, more sustainable nursing career.

## 2. Perspective  
- **Broader view of healthcare systems** – Exposure to multiple hospitals and practices reveals many ways to solve systemic issues.  
- **Hope and inspiration** – Seeing creative solutions elsewhere fuels optimism and personal investment in improving patient care.  
- **Enhanced clinical insight** – Diverse experiences deepen understanding of patient care beyond a single institution’s approach.

## 3. Options  
- **Expanded career pathways** – Travel nursing provides a wide range of clinical experiences, making it easier to decide between travel, full‑time staff, per‑diem, or other roles.  
- **Seasonal approach to nursing** – Recognizes that a nursing career can have different “seasons,” each offering distinct opportunities.  
- **Strategic leverage** – The skills and knowledge gained can be used to negotiate or select the best permanent position when the time comes.

---

### Closing Thought  
Travel nursing acted as a **career reset** for Zac, giving him flexibility, a new perspective, and a clearer view of his professional options—helping him stay in nursing longer and with renewed enthusiasm.

**5 Benefits of Staying with One Agency**  
*Aya Healthcare – December 19, 2023 (Traveler Tips)*  

---

### 1. Recruiter Relationship  
- A strong recruiter is the most important partner in a travel‑nursing career.  
- Good recruiters understand your needs, communicate clearly, and provide support throughout the assignment.  
- They help navigate licensing (including NLC and state‑specific licenses) and handle complex paperwork, allowing you to focus on patient care.  
- Trust in your recruiter builds confidence in the entire agency.

### 2. Transparency & “Total Value” of Pay & Benefits  
- Look beyond the headline weekly pay; consider the full compensation package.  
- Transparent agencies disclose relocation reimbursements, liability insurance, on‑contract support, and other benefits.  
- Evaluating the **total value** of an assignment prevents hidden costs and ensures you receive fair overall compensation.  

### 3. Job Access & Real‑Time Updates  
- Staying with a single agency gives you consistent access to a wide network of facilities.  
- Aya’s platform updates job details in real time, reducing lag and confusion common on other sites.  
- If a position isn’t listed, recruiters can provide market insight and honest advice on whether to pursue it.

### 4. Streamlined Credentialing Process  
- Credentialing can be lengthy and repetitive when using multiple agencies.  
- Aya offers an online portal and a dedicated credentialing team that stores documents, tracks requirements, and ensures you’re ready for each new assignment.  
- This continuity speeds start dates and avoids missed opportunities.

### 5. Opportunities for Extensions & Professional Equity  
- Extensions allow you to stay longer at a facility you like, providing stability while retaining the flexibility of travel nursing.  
- Extensions are more likely when you have a trusted relationship with both the agency and the hospital.  
- Re‑assignments at the same site help you build a strong reputation, expand your professional network, and enhance future career prospects.

---

### One Agency, More Opportunity  
While using multiple agencies may seem to broaden options, the combined benefits of a trusted recruiter, transparent compensation, real‑time job access, efficient credentialing, and the chance for extensions make a single‑agency partnership the most effective strategy for a successful travel‑nursing career.

**Title:** 5 Tips to Land Your Dream Travel Assignment  
**Author:** Aya Healthcare (blog)  
**Date Published:** October 13, 2021  
**Category:** Traveler Tips  

---

### Introduction  
Dreaming of hiking the Pacific Northwest, eating deep‑dish pizza in Chicago, or watching the Northern Lights in Alaska? Whether you want to work in a specific hospital or visit all 50 states, turning that travel‑nurse dream into reality can feel overwhelming. Below are five practical tips to help you secure the travel assignment you’ve been picturing.

---

### 1. Prioritize Your Travel Goals  
- **Create a checklist** of what matters most (location, pay, shift type, lifestyle).  
- Identify **deal‑breakers** versus items you’re willing to compromise on.  
- Example: If a coveted location like Hawaii is your top priority, you might accept a lower rate or different shift pattern to get there.  
- Clear goals guide your decisions and keep you focused on the assignments that truly align with your aspirations.

### 2. Utilize Your Recruiter  
- Recruiters do more than find jobs; they support you throughout your travel career.  
- Communicate your goals clearly so they can match you with suitable assignments.  
- They can help you build experience, making you a stronger candidate for future dream positions.  
- Leverage their network and expertise, especially when you’re just starting out.

### 3. Be Flexible  
- Rigid expectations can limit opportunities.  
- Flexibility with schedule, patient populations, or specific unit assignments makes you more attractive to hospitals.  
- Being open to varied assignments increases the likelihood of landing competitive positions and expands your experience.

### 4. Build Your Clinical Skill Set  
- A robust skill set helps you stand out.  
- Review your Aya profile’s skill checklist; target low‑rated areas (1‑2) and work to improve them to 3‑4.  
- Seek certifications relevant to your specialty to boost credibility and resume appeal.  
- Strong clinical competence reassures hospitals that you can hit the ground running.

### 5. Seek Out New Experiences  
- Employers value nurses who have worked with diverse patient populations and settings.  
- Ask your recruiter for assignments that broaden your exposure (different units, locations, patient types).  
- Each assignment is an adventure; saying “yes” to varied opportunities can lead to unexpected favorite cities or hospitals.
